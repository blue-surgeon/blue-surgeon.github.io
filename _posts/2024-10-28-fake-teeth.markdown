## You ever seen Vampire’s Kiss? 

Most likely you remember it for [this meme](https://indiehoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/nicolas-cage-meme.jpg), this exasperated naming of the [alphabet](https://youtu.be/4zySHepF04c?si=Uj_4Tus5TkeAt1lA&t=32), or this [moaning in the street](https://youtu.be/4zySHepF04c?si=gheTES6peTxlYg4l&t=9). Vampire’s Kiss is a black comedy horror film released in 1988. It is most well-known for Nicolas Cage’s chaotic performance as the protagonist Peter Loew, literary agent turned vampire.This very chaos is why I watched it for the first time 4 years ago, and why I thought it would be funny if I wrote a song about it. Years later I have completed these tasks, but I find I have a lot to say.

*(Content Warning: misogyny, sexual assault, stalking, murder, self-harm- details will be mostly vague but it will come up <3)*

I watched Vampire’s Kiss for the first time, eagerly awaiting the next time Nicolas Cage would do something crazy (give it like 2 minutes at the most), while taking notes in between for song lyrics. It was interesting to learn the context for all the weird clips I saw on Youtube, specifically the alphabet one. I laughed a lot, and then surprisingly felt incredibly sad. I was going through a lot at the time, so I never thought to investigate why- it could’ve been 8 different things, last of which was the movie -so I moved on. 
On my second watch, I figured out why. Peter Loew stalks, harasses and rapes a secretary working in his office, and murders a woman in a nightclub. All of this violence escalates in tandem with his fall to chaos. I am no stranger to sexual and gendered violence- did may brain protect me the first time around? Was Peter Loew’s chaos so large it loomed over the violence in this movie?
On my next 2 viewings, I tried to honor both the distress and the humor. Safe to say it was an emotional whirlwind. I didn't know how to reconcile these 2 vibes. But now I think that's the point. To me, the juxtaposition of chaotic silliness and violence is the point of this movie. I'll show you what I mean. 
I'm going to dissect this movie (not every little thing but at least a good chunk), and the results are below. There will be spoilers, but I would be shocked if it ruined the movie for you. It is truly an experience unto itself. 
(Also, I <mark>highlighted</mark> my description of any parts I sample in the disco song I made.)

### Here’s who we’re dealing with- 

*Peter Loew*, literary agent, the protagonist
*Alva*, the newest secretary in his office
*Jackie*, the woman he dates briefly and royally destroys his chances with
*Dr. Glaser*, Peter's female therapist
*Rachel*, the vampire lady that is (mostly) a hallucination

Which is to say-we have a man surrounded by women he doesn’t respect. This movie frames itself as a love story, as we will see, but obviously there is a lot more going on. Any movie times are approximate. 

We open on a bunch of random pictures of NYC, and eventually pan over to Peter in therapy, saying “I wanted her, same as always, I wanted her to disappear”. So vague and sentimental. Moving on!
**0:05:00** Peter and Jackie are having a lot of fun together- here we see chaotic-fun-respectful Peter, a Peter we will soon miss. They go to his apartment and start hooking up. Then a “bat” flies into the room. Jackie runs out. Peter tries to “shoo” it away, but is unsuccessful. They leave. Now let’s take a moment to appreciate that bat- what a beauty. ![bat](/assets/images/fake_teeth/bat.jpg) If you want to learn about how bad Nicolas wanted a real bat, read [this](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/6/13/18663380/nicolas-cage-vampires-kiss-breakout-performance-30-years). 
**0:09:00** At the office, Peter patronizingly asks Alva to find an old contract for a client, Frank Heatherton. This file has been mis-filed, and because of that, it requires Alva to look for through the comically large ‘Der Spiegel’ file.
**0:12:30** Peter tries to end his own therapy session, and Dr. Glaser asks if he feels insecure when she ends the session- a hint at his misogyny. Then, Peter reluctantly tells her that he found the bat, yes, *the bat*, arousing. She’s surprised but still wants to discuss it, but they run out of time. 
**0:16:00** Peter meets the real life Rachel at a bar. From what we can tell, they go to his place to hook up, Rachel soon reveals her fangs and feeds on his neck. He is not into it- until he is. The next morning we see Peter with an uninjured neck- but Peter soon cuts himself from shaving in the same spot Rachel feeds. And then we watch him serve coffee in bed to no one- vampire Rachel is a hallucination!! and he wasn't actually bitten!!

From here on out, Peter oscillates between this post-feeding haze and his regular self. Whenever Rachel shows up and feeds, he becomes hypnotized, continues to 'fall in love', and starts to lose his shit. And then he does a bad-enough thing and exits the haze, horrified of his actions. This cycle becomes extremely apparent with Alva. 

**0:20:00** He beefs it with Jackie. They’re at an art show, Jackie asks “Do you like it?” In response, Peter says he has to piss, walks away, pauses, and speed-walks directly out of the building into a cab (with a comical amount of intensity).
**0:23:00** Back in the office, Peter learns over the phone that **Frank Heatherton is not pressed about the contract, and specifies that there is no rush on finding it**. Alva's present when he makes this call, but she doesn't hear the call itself-so Peter fibs. He says it *is* urgent, and Frank may switch agencies if it isn’t delivered quickly. So this begs the question- what’s your little obsession about Peter? Going on a little power trip because a bat aroused you and then Rachel the vampire-lady-hallucination arrived?  Feeling like you’re losing control because you don’t understand what’s happening to you so you find the lowest ranking woman in your office to mess with because it’s socially acceptable in 1980s America? He’s displacing his vampiric concerns with this invented filing debacle. Also he strikes the following pose while saying 
![what a point](/assets/images/fake_teeth/pointing1.jpg)
>“Am I getting through to you, Alva” 
I’m stealing it but only for situations without abuse of existing power dynamics. And when he strikes that pose, I briefly forget what an ass he is. 

Peter convinces Jackie to meet him so he can explain his actions, but Rachel sabotages the meetup. She feeds on him again- he is quicker to enjoy himself this time around. Like I said before, this induces a post-feeding haze. We see Peter in his office, staring at his desk and talking to himself. Then, unsurprisingly he remembers Alva, his favorite power trip victim, and <mark>yells her name repeatedly with a cadence Alvin the chipmunk would recognize</mark>. Everybody hears- which is in itself inappropriate and embarrassing. Then, we get more pointing (as shown below) as Peter jumps on a desk, points at her and says 
![another point](/assets/images/fake_teeth/pointing2.jpg) 
>“<mark>There you are!</mark>”. 
She starts running away, and he follows looking like a speed walker with good form (arms involved and everything!). This continues, ending in the women’s restroom. 
*aside: Here, we meet the first of 2 people who yell at Peter in the bathroom. She’s an old white secretary who yells “<mark>AH!!</mark>, What the hell is he doing here?” as she leaves the stall, washes her hands, and later walks towards the camera saying “What the fuck is going on?”. She understands us in this instance.*
Meanwhile, Alva promises to report this incident, says she has a gun and threatens to use it if he ever touches her. After seeing how scared Alva is, Peter realizes what he’s done, and profusely apologizes. Alva does report it, but head of the company not only doesn't care, but finds it funny. Peter comes home to a note from Jackie reading “STAY OUT OF MY LIFE” and starts destroying his apartment. Simultaneously, Alva takes the subway home, and we learn she really does have a gun. 

**0:38:00** Alas, we have arrived at the angry alphabet scene. Peter tells Dr. Glaser about the filing problem, specifically bewildered by the fact that anyone misfiled anything ever. He says you only have to go in alphabetical order- and then recites the alphabet with poses and a lot of gusto.
![the first set](/assets/images/fake_teeth/abc1.jpg) 
Above are some notable dance moves for the bulk of the alphabet, in the last picture he's clapping. And the first two pictures below are his dance moves for the end of the alphabet. *(yes you can watch this scene, and you probably have, but I found it really fun to add a timeline of my favorite moments with an amateur photoshop job)*
![the second set](/assets/images/fake_teeth/abc2.jpg)  However, I would like to point out the dialogue here:
>Dr. Glaser: “very good, you know your alphabet”
>Peter: “I’ve never misfiled anything! Not once! Not one time!” (this is when he crosses his arms in the pics above)
>Dr. Glaser: “I’m sure that you didn’t”
>Peter: “I wanna know really, who did?!”
>Dr. Glaser: “I cannot possibly tell you that”
>Peter: “you can’t?”
>Dr. Glaser: “no i can’t”
>Peter: “ha! and you call yourself a psychiatrist” sighs “its kinda bright in here isn’t it” (it’s not) <br>
Regarding that last line- It’s unsurprising for Peter to have unrealistic expectations for the women around him, it’s a ‘you overcompensate for my inadequacy thing’. That being said, the idea that psychiatrists know all misfiling 'offenses' is fucking *wild*. Also, Peter acts so childish in this scene! You see those poses? My guy, what is happening here. It’s funny but also he's a grown man with power and resources my god. 
Then we immediately cut to Peter at the office, wearing sunglasses, smoking a cigarette performatively looking through files, probably thinking about all the times he never misfiled anything. ![wow](/assets/images/fake_teeth/smokingsunglasses.jpg)

**0:42:00** Still at the office, it’s the end of the work day, and Alva is dressed and ready to leave. Peter calls a different secretary to tell Alva to come talk to him (wild way to handle that, I guess he’s too good to get up or call her himself). She finds Peter in his office cartoon villain style, with his back to her in a swivel chair, wearing sunglasses, eating pistachios. He fake apologizes, claims mescaline made him follow her into the bathroom, and then swivels around with dramatic music to accompany him. He asks that she stay late to look for the contract, and refuses to let anyone help her. It is in this conversation that we get the classic meme face (he holds iot for over 30 real life seconds) while telling Alva that it’s a terrible job that she alone deserves to have- after all, she is the newest secretary. He threatens to fire her if she doesn’t stay late, but as he says it he realizes how much of an ass he is. Of course he doesn’t change course, but after she leaves, he softly says “Don’t you want to use your gun, Alva”. We’re certainly on our way there Peter!

Peter’s well-being continues to disintegrate. This entails many theatrical reactions to things vampire's generally don't like- crosses, sunlight. My favorite example is when he walks home with groceries, and full-on *collapses* because he *looks* at a neon cross (this scene gets me every time, I don’t think there’s any context in any vampire movie that a glance at a cross makes you collapse-but who knows). Rachel feeds on him again, and he famously eats a cockroach. 

**0:51:00** Back to Alva. She calls in sick, because despite staying very late, she did not find the contract. In response, Peter *finds her address and takes a cab all the way to her home*. When he arrives, he peeks at her through the window and knocks, emphasizes that he brought "soup!", and says he owes her an apology. Alva answers the door, and with the soup packet in her face admits she isn’t actually sick (I wish she lied her, but I don't know that it would matter). Peter tells Alva that *he doesn’t care if he loses Frank as a client*, heavily implying the file debacle is over. He doesn’t say he previously lied, because that would involve admitting his little obsession, just that he doesn’t care about 'losing Frank’s business'. This admission motivates Alva to take a cab with Peter back to work. On the way, literal minutes later, Peter chaotically admits he lied (and then heaves), saying the contract still has to be somewhere, and she’s gonna look for it today. In response, out of fear, Alva has them stop at a gas station where her brother Emilio works to ask for help. We learn that Emilio originally gave her the gun *without bullets*, but given the circumstances, she’s looking for ammo. Turns out, he doesn’t even have real bullets, just blanks, so Alva leaves with those. 
**0:59:00** Peter is angry because he spent a bunch of money on the taxi that *he chose to take unnecessarilly*. He touches Alva’s shoulder saying he spent $50 to get her to work, and pulls her head back with her braid saying “You better make it worth it to me”. This is the first time he touches her.
**1:00:00** *Later that day, it is time for Peter, yet again, to get yelled at in the bathroom- this time the men’s room.* He washes his face, looks in the mirror, pants, yells “Where am i?”, and verbally concludes he’s a vampire. *He switches to a different mirror (this bathroom has got mirror options) and says “Oh, God, where am i?” and some guy from the office says “You’re in the goddamn crapper Loew and I’m trying to take a dump.” Imagine taking a dump and Nicolas Cage is losing his shit right outside your stall, yelling at himself in the mirror.*
Anyway, after returning to his office, Rachel visits and feeds on him again- mind you, he's been 'falling in love' with her this whole time. In the aftermath, Peter ‘logically’ concludes that the source of all his problems is “I never found the right woman”. Uplifting music swells. *Here’s what I think about this love story bullshit- Peter can only see a woman fitting in his life if it’s in a romantic sense. He’s surrounded by women he’s threatened by and can only think, what if i found the right lady through?*
**1:02:00** Alva finds the contract! (If you thought this would help her in some way, I'm sad to inform you it doesn't.) She excitedly tells Peter, only to discover that it’s 'too late’. This has nothing to do with the file- there’s no real stakes- and everything to do with Peter being too far gone. Of course he yells directly at Alva instead, taunting her with a “Too Late” as he chases her into the basement of the building. She smartly grabs her gun, threatens him with it, and in response, he asks her to kill him or 'he’ll fire her'. She shoots at the floor multiple times, hoping to scare him without revealing the bullets aren’t real. He ‘feeds’ on her, then rapes her. Rachel shows up, <mark>laughing at how ridiculous he looks</mark>, concluding “You’re with me now, my angel." Afterwards he shoots himself with the gun, but it has no effect. To him, this provides further proof of his vampirism- he’s immortal! He taps on Alva’s shoulder to tell her he’s a vampire now (This part always gets to me. She's a *little* too busy being traumatized to celebrate her rapist becoming a fake vampire).

Peter goes all in on the vampirism for the rest of the movie. Breaks all the mirrors in his house, eats a pigeon, makes a coffin out of an upside down couch. **He goes to buy fangs from a store- the mere act of which proves he is not a vampire- and he can’t afford the more realistic ones, so he buys the cheap plastic ones**. In a moment of clarity, he calls and books an earlier appointment with Dr. Glaser. 

**01:17:00** Armed with fake fangs, he goes to a nightclub. There he finds a woman alone in an enormous room in the back of the club (so weird), and ‘feeds’ on her. Notably, *he uses his real teeth to do so, putting his fake fangs back on after*. Afterwards, Rachel shows up as a hallucination to mock him, including the guy she's with. We see their real-life counterparts as Peter leaves the club exclaiming “You’re breaking up with me? after I sucked that broad booooooooone dry”. He believes Rachel and him fell in love, but after seeing her in real life, he’s been dumped!!
**1:26:00** It’s morning now. Peter rips the pointiest piece of wood off a palette to function as a stake, that is still incredibly, unsettlingly blunt. ![blunt stake](/assets/images/fake_teeth/stake.jpg) Freaks out in front of a church, moans, asks two random people to kill him because his girlfriend broke up with him. During this time we see the headline “Disco Death, girl victim of bizarre murder” confirming his kill hours before (a little soon for a newspaper but I digress). 
Meanwhile, Alva confides in Emilio what happened, and they are in wait outside Peters apartment so Emilio can settle the score. 

**1:29:00** It’s time for the psychiatrist appointment Peter booked a bit earlier. At last, his hallucinatory world and his physical world are in direct comparison. In the former, he’s in a suit in Dr. Glaser’s office, standing up, commanding the space, and in the latter, he’s covered in blood talking to himself on a street corner. In both scenarios he has his incredibly blunt stake, and the dialogue is the same. 
Peter has something to say, and asks Dr. Glaser to promise she won’t laugh. In response, she says one of my favorite lines in the whole movie, “I’m a professional, I don’t laugh.” Peter tells Dr. Glaser that her profession is a bogus waste of money, and all his problems will be solved when he finds love. She laughs (lol), but only because she has a woman named Sharon, right outside, who is perfect for him! After Sharon comes in, we learn they have everything in common, things we never knew Peter liked the whole movie! But remember all the violence he did? He does too, and he essentially asks Dr. Glaser for permission to not care. 
>Peter: “I did rape someone a couple nights ago. A girl at the office. I just lost control.”
>Dr. Glaser: “It’s just a little id release, no use in worrying.”
>Peter: sighs “I just thought I should tell you, it’s a load off my mind” also.. “Well the fact is, I did murder someone last night, I turned into a vampire, it’s a long story.” 
>Sharon: “Goodness” (understatement of the year)
>Dr. Glaser: “Peter, Peter, Peter. People get murdered everyday in this city, do you think the world is going to stop?” <br>
Dr. Glaser promises to take care of the cops, and sends the new couple on their way to enjoy their life together. 
Peter takes Sharon home (AKA talks to himself, covered in blood, holding an absurdly blunt stake, while walking to his apartment alone) and she just can't get over the vampire thing! (I got to say, Sharon is wild for this response, I would at least throw candid admission of murder up there). She asks about the stake, and he says “I turned into a vampire last week, it’s all in the past now. okay?” Sharon still wants to talk about it, despite his objections, so as he walks up the stairs of his apartment he yells “Goddamnit, what’d I just say?” In this moment, Alva spots him, and Emilio follows him up to his apartment. After arriving home, Peter breaks up with Sharon. When Emilio opens the door, Peter thinks its Sharon leaving. Ironically, he then says, “I really can’t handle these relationships, maybe I should see a shrink”; then he heaves, screams, and hides under his upside down couch. Emilio walks in and pushes the couch off of him. Peter makes it clear he wants to die, holding the stake to his heart, and Emilio pushes it. Only the bluntest stake could take him down. 

---

In many senses, his vampire teeth are fake. He’s not a vampire, he couldn’t even afford the nice vampire fangs. His vampire teeth are so obviously fake it’s played for laughs. And while his ‘vampirism’ provided a stress to bring out Peter's fragile ego, it doesn't make him stalk, rape and murder (if the teeth are fake why can't the murder be too?). He's a guy, who's also a misogynist, with no accountability from himself or others, with resources and power, who takes his frustration out on the most vulnerable women around him. Alva was the newest secretary, and the woman in the nightclub was alone. Besides, when he killed her, he didn’t even use his fangs, he used his real teeth. These fangs only serve as a distraction from the real issue at hand.
The point is that there’s a distinction between the delusion and his behavior. The point is that he looks ‘crazy’ for the whole damn movie except when he’s taking his power out on women. No one is surprised this happens. I was surprised I missed it, but I wasn’t surprised by it. No one talks about how crazy the rape scene was in this movie, they talk about how Nicolas Cage took the “<mark>Boo-Hoo</mark>” written in the script as a challenge when Peter cries out after committing the act. Granted, the rape scene isn’t graphic, but he admits it at the end of the movie- there’s no doubt that it happened, we all saw it. 
The teeth are fake but the violence is real. It’s easier for him to believe he’s succumbed to something mythical than deal with his real problems. And I wouldn’t care that much if the cost wasn’t Alva’s safety and someone’s life. 

So, why does this movie resonate with me so much? I've met a few Peter's in my day. The most violent men I know lose their shit over the silliest things. They don't have patterns of behavior that revolve around fake vampirism, but there's a theme of entitlement, misogyny and dominance.
This is why I love the alphabet scene- someone misfiled Frank Heatherton's contract, so Peter makes it a big deal so Alva thinks it's a big deal, and then he's calling Dr. Glaser a bad psychiatrist because she doesn't know who did it. Why does Peter need to know? What would he do about it? Doesn't he have a job to do? Why is he emotionally regressing? And why is 'who did it' a question he's even thinking about? We know Peter is projecting some internal issues onto this scenario, and these issues are related to why he did the violent things he did in the movie. Simultaneously, needing to prove your competency at filing by yelling the alphabet is funny. 
So I laugh, because in realizing how internally fragile these men are, I find them less scary. And I remember that there's an internal strength and security that I cultivate, that they don't have. Why do I know that? Because people who are secure in themselves don't do the violent shit Peter Loew did in this movie.

Thank you for reading. 

**Here's the disco song promised earlier!**

P.S. [I mentioned an article earlier](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/6/13/18663380/nicolas-cage-vampires-kiss-breakout-performance-30-years)- about how Nicolas wanted a real bat. If you want to learn more about the making of the movie, it's a good read. However, I have to share my favorite quote (which is someone paraphrasing someone else communicating what Nicolas Cage wants):
>“Nicolas wants to eat a water bug instead of sucking on the egg.” <br>
The context for this quote only makes it slightly less absurd.
