I’m a big Wicked fan. The deeper you get into Wicked ~lore~, the more interesting it becomes. I saw the broadway show when I was young (retaining virtually nothing), I saw Part 1 of the movie a few months ago (finally learned what I saw on Broadway 20 years earlier), and I just finished reading the book that started it all- “Wicked” by Gregory Maguire. But don’t forget about the original L Frank Baum book(s). And who could forget the movie “Wizard of Oz”?
I’ve read and heard a lot of opinions about Wicked, the book. It is not child appropriate _at all_, turning Oz into a world with religion, fascism, and complex moral questions. It is not a joyous book by any means, anything Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West) holds dear is ripped from her in a heartbreaking and poignant way. And most fascinating to me, it draws upon the “Wizard of Oz” movie and the L Frank Baum text in separate ways. In the “Wizard of Oz” the Wicked Witch of the West has green face paint to show off the new technicolor technology in movie making- but in the original LFB text, the wicked witch is not green. Same with the magic slippers on the feet of the Wicked Witch of the East, red in the movie, but silver in both books. A lot of world building is drawn from the LFB text, but the storyline (as far as Dorothy and her friends are concerned) draws from the “Wizard of Oz”.
The same exoskeleton of a story told in new formats with new perspectives. 
“Wicked” is a dark mature reimagining of the Wicked Witch of the West that gives her character depth and humanity, and a hell of the name (Elphaba - eLFaBa - LFB - now whose initials are those…)- and from what I’ve heard, John Updike really liked it (his review was “amazing novel” on my physical copy) and everyone else hated it. 
_(major spoilers ahead, reader discretion advised. there’s also mentions of SA and murder and political violence)_

Page 15 does include a male puppet with 2 ‘snakes’ having an incestuous threesome. It’s a lot. It’s a warning shot for anyone giving this book to their young kids. But I’ve seen Pink Flamingos I was fine. 
This book intends to make you uncomfortable. This isn’t inherently bad. The puppet intercourse tones down for the rest of the book. 
Seriously though, I love this book, and I love the way it handles destiny and control. It speaks to me in the world I currently live in.
So you know how Maguire drew from the original movie and book? Baked into the lore of Oz is ~another world~, and this other world is ours, Earth, the one in which Oz was created and reshaped over decades. One night the Wizard, originally from Earth, visits Elphaba’s mom with a green bottle labelled “Magical Eli—” and he fathers a child.  A green child of **both worlds**. Both Oz and earth, specifically late-1800s early 1900s America. Elphaba drinks this elixr in her last weeks alive in Oz, and has visions of the ocean, something Oz is geographically lacking. She intentionally becomes an insomniac because the visions she had were so terrifying. ![Map of Oz](/assets/images/el_fa_ba/Ozmap.jpg)
The Wizard is a fascist, who gradually rises to power over the course of Elphaba’s life. His night of hopefully consensual passion was just about a year into his time in Oz. There is a parallel between Elphaba’s life breaking apart and Oz itself breaking apart under the Wizard’s rule in her 38 years of life. He leaves as she dies (2 events sparked by Dorothy’s time on Oz).
One notable criticism of “Wicked” is the sheer amount of violence in the world, and how normalized it is. The nature of Elphaba’s conception is not clarified as far as consent goes. Elphaba does have a fairly healthy sexual and romantic relationship with someone, who is murdered violently by the military. Elphaba’s mentor, Doctor Dillamond, an Animal (an animal with human consciousness), is murdered because his groundbreaking research threatens the Wizard’s plan to make Animals the great scapegoat. 
Elphaba’s family resents her from the beginning for having green skin, and the events that unfolded because of it. Her dad, a minister, feels responsible for the murder of a Quadling, a family friend during Elphaba’s youth. Her dad proselytizes to the unsuspecting Quadlings and points **directly at (green) Elphaba** and says “don’t you think this is punishment enough?” 
Her sister, Nessarose, is born without arms, because her mother took a tonic during pregnancy to avoid having another green child. Elphaba is Nessarose’s caretaker for most of her childhood, in addition to their Nanny. When her and her sister are at school, their father gifts Nessarose the beautiful silver slippers, and gives Elphaba nothing. This wound persists for years, making Elphaba feel like a punishment to her family rather than a gift, rather than a human. Unsurprisingly, Elphaba decides to distance herself from her family (and friends) for years, until her Nanny finds her again. Around this same time, Nessarose becomes leader of Munchkinland, overseeing their secession from greater Oz. This only sours Elphaba’s attempt to reunite with her family because her father worries more about her sister’s ability to rule than reuniting with Elphaba. After Nessarose dies and Dorothy gets her silver shoes, Elphaba follows her across Oz to get them, only to eventually learn they literally can't come off.
To me, if Oz is under fascism, a disjointed, painful, lonely life makes sense. Living under that kind of government surely affects the interpersonal lives of its citizens- it certainly doesn’t teach consent or humanity. 
There are strong themes of forgiveness that run throughout the book. Elphaba’s dad asks for forgiveness for complicity in murder, she herself asks for forgiveness from the wife of her dead lover, and Dorothy asks Elphaba for forgiveness for killing her sister. Nobody gets it. Granted, these are big asks, but forgiveness is seen wholly as something given from someone else. Nobody thinks that maybe they need to forgive themselves. 
Elphaba feels responsible for the Wizard’s behavior after a lifetime of fighting his policies and violence, but she lets this guilt break her away from her own humanity, something difficult but critical to maintain in a violent world. Learning that she is his blood is gut wrenching. She spends nearly the whole book dunking on religion and ruminating on how anyone can believe they have a soul in this world- which is why learning of ‘another world’ is disturbing to her. If there's a whole other world, whose to say souls aren't real?
But she forgets- she is not just born of Oz. She is also born of the world that created Oz. 
Maguire alludes to her choosing to be female numerous times throughout the book. She continually changes names, from Fabala, Elphie, Elphaba, Auntie Guest, witch, Wicked Witch of the West- eventually embracing witch-hood because it offered her more freedom. She has a book of magic, the Grimmerie, from our world that she can use because the language is somehow familiar to her. She has so many familiars, a dog, a monkey, bees and crows, relationships she cultivated over many years. She has love and care in her life, people who admire her conviction and strength despite decades apart. At the end of her life, the Animals of Oz consider her a champion, even though many humans may not[^1].
She is a creator, an author. She is placed in a world, but she is not of that world entirely. 
I am her. We are her. We have physical bodies and consciousness, or a soul, or whatever else you might call it. I’ve always felt a distinction between what my body wants and what my soul wants. It could be as simple as ‘I really want to finish that song but I’m very tired- if I go to bed now I’ll have more energy to create tomorrow'. Or sharing your feelings with someone important to you even though the thought of doing that makes you nauseous. Maybe you call it something different, maybe you don’t know what the heck I’m talking about. Maybe it’s because I’m non-binary, and know I am both man and woman but neither one entirely. Or maybe for the astrology bitches out there, it’s because my Mars is in Libra, and in anything I do I see the ways it will affect me, body and soul. 

The line in the book that inspired this blog post, 
>> The body apologizes to the soul for its errors, and the soul asks forgiveness for squatting in the body without invitation (452)
<br>
This line follows a description of Elphaba’s death. 
Dorothy never wants to kill her, only to ask for forgiveness for killing her sister. Elphaba wanted the shoes on Dorothy’s feet because her dad gifted them to her sister, and gave her nothing. She wanted her dad’s love. 

I don’t think our body’s and our soul’s need to be in conflict. I interpret Elphaba’s refusal to see her soul as a refusal of her humanity, to view her need for love and acceptance as taxing, rather than a crucial and worthwhile search. This search is more crucial than ever. 
I think the experiment of being human is about the balancing of the body and soul. And the magic that can happen if they are aligned. 
Wicked makes me want to search for that magic more than I already did.
