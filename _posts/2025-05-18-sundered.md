**(spoilers included)**
Sundered is a video game that offers you 3 endings, and the 2 that offer true transformation are the most extreme. 
There are 7 ability shrines thoughout the game. Everytime you have a full elder shard (from bosses, mini-bosses or exploration), you can bring it to an ability shrine to have that ability 'enhanced' or 'corrupted' with eldritch power. You can *also* burn that eldritch shard, and use game currency to buy an extra secret upgrade in the skill tree. I played the game twice, once to fully embrace eldritch power, and once to fully ignore it; each of these results in different ending (the third ending is a mix of the two, some eldritch power, some not).
Here's the results of my playthroughs:

## Edritch Path
One notable fact about this game is the creepy narrator, who watches and comments on your every action. They talk so much shit about needing upgrade your abilities with eldritch power that I just embraced it for my first try. Another impotant note: hoardes. A gong would hit, and all of a sudden you're surrounded by enemies- it does end, but you don't know when and if you can't kill them fast enough, it's very overwhelming. This game is tough enough that I didn't want to waste my precious elder shards. I also didn't know what upgrades I would be getting, and I was excited to see what weird eldritch flavor they'd take on after getting corrupted- every new ability or upgrade was something new to discover.
Also, they chose a really nice purple and blue to respresent the eldritch powers (I'm very color-oriented, the keyboard I'm typing on right now has custom multi-colored lighting lol). And, a lot of the upgrades were cool as hell- I wanted to look a like a spider climbing up a wall, ![lil spider guy](/assets/images/sundered/lil_spider_guy.jpg) I wanted to look like this little guy when floating through the air. ![lil guy](/assets/images/sundered/lil_guy.jpg) The best part of the eldritch upgrades were how cool they looked, but some felt a big overindulgent to play with. However, I think this is great game design because it reflects the path I chose in the game. The spider guy is fun to be when climbing up and down a wall; but I didn't really need the ability to stick to walls- theoretically cool, less practically cool.
So I arrived at the final area/boss. After doing exactly what the creep wanted me too for so long, they seemed way too excited I was ready to beat the game. It was pretty clear something obviously evil was about to occur.
For the final boss I fought the humane version of myself multiple times. First one on one, then trapped in crystal with the boss **Humanity** trying to protect me. Then I became an eldritch God, and slayed my old self once and for all. ![killing my humane self](/assets/images/sundered/killing_humane_self.jpg) If it's not clear, the evil me is glowing in purple holding a scythe.
The ritual is complete, I am now the narrator. 

## Pure Good
For my second playthrough, I chose Hard Mode (video games are much easier when I know what to expect), and I mentally prepared myself to piss the narrator off with every elder shard I was about to destroy. 
So, here's the thing- when you first destroy a shard, the narrator barks at you, you get some game currency and seemingly that's it. Only when you return to home base do you realize you got a special upgrade available. On the first try, it seems like you get nothing unique after busting your ass, and when you see what you got, you still have to buy it. These upgrades also have little correlation with the abilities you have; there's a lot more ambiguity in terms of what you get. This path requires trust in the game to have your back for ignoring the whines of the narrator. And after finishing it, I think the trust was well deserved. All the upgrades were super helpful- damaging enemies while dodging, a triple jump, an upgraded cannon (yes, you get a melee weapon and a comically large cannon). The explosion after a downward attack saved my ass many times. All these abilities made fighting hoardes easier. You even got an extra perk slot, which enables you to enhance your abilities for whatever you're trying to do. The eldritch upgrades looked a lot cooler, but these made the game better to play.
I enjoyed the narrator's resigned acceptance after I destroyed most of the elder shards. However, in the final area, they were back with their bullshit, claiming that after disappointing them I could still be useful for their goals. 
The first final boss was **Chaos**, reminiscent of the other main bosses in the game. After you beat them, the narrator reveals their true form, and takes away your melee weapon. 
Luckily I still had my human-made cannon, and the game was kind enough to sprinkle cannon ammo all over then ground. Killing the narrarator in his true form was fun, and I definitely felt set up for success. 
So you know how the other playthrough ended with the completion of a ritual? Essentially the whole game is a little universe in the middle of the desert that traps an unsuspecting human into completing this ritual for the narrator. After killing him, they a show a little animation that implies the cycle is over.

I liked both endings. I really like this game. Even when I was annoyed at my progress the art is so beautiful I didn't even care. 
I think the way upgrades were handled on each path reflects well narratively on the game. Often choosing the 'right path' is hard, ambiguous, and you know better what you stand to lose than what you stand to gain.
As of writing this, I've decided to leave the city I currently live in. I know my community will miss me, my friends will miss me- I'll miss the city, at least a little bit. But as my friend told me, those that are meant to stay in my life will follow me, virtually if not otherwise. As of writing this, I don't know where I will go. I have a loose timeline and a few ideas, and that's about it. So much is unclear, but I know it's still the right choice for me. 

Thanks for reading. 

Everytime I got to be the little floating guy I was so happy. Here's a song inspired by the lil floating guy:
