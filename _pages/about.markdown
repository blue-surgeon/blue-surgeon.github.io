        I'm lucky enough to have a lot of creative energy. 
It is never satisfied when channeled in only one direction- music has my heart, but sometimes (*often*) I have to draw, do my makeup, change my outfit, change my hair, watch something silly (then decide it's profound) or reorganize my shoes again. I made this blog by learning some basic coding, and alas, I have found another output for my creative energy. But what I also found was a way to display many artistic projects in one.

        I'm sitting on a stack of sick art. 
My friends know that I don't draw people, or objects, or landscapes. Instead, I draw abstract lines and swirls. A lot of flower-looking things that I've been told, *on multiple occasions*, look like legendary pokemon. I display many of my drawings in my apartment, but I think they want bigger and better things.

        I'm sitting on a pile of sick music. I feel like a dragon, but not in a cool fire breathing way, more in the hoarding sense. Of course, it is my choice whether I share any of it, but I want to, and have wanted to for a long time.

        At most points in time I have a latest media obsession. Occasionally it is serious, like Guillermo del Toro's "[Crimson Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimson_Peak)" or Lynne Ramsay's "[You Were Never Really Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Were_Never_Really_Here)", but most of the time it is absolutely not. Some titles that come to mind- [The Lizzie McGuire Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lizzie_McGuire_Movie), [the Teletubbies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletubbies), [One Tree Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Tree_Hill_(TV_series)), [Vampire's Kiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire%27s_Kiss), or that video game called "[Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnip_Boy_Commits_Tax_Evasion)". That last one wasn't quite an obsession, but did gently touch my heart strings (I intentionally saved it for a bad day).

        I find the above three categories come together in a poetic way, often when I have a lesson to learn or a habit to unpack. I don't believe in coincidences, but I do believe that even my silliest interests have something important to say. Each post covers another moment of *confluence* in my life. Less a moment in time, but more a moment of understanding how my creative output aligns together. Sometimes I'll explain why each piece comes together, sometimes I won't. But I will always have something interesting to say.

        *I made this blog because I only felt comfortable sharing these thoughts and music and art and feelings if I had my own corner of the internet. I love to see the cool stuff people make, and the cool things my friends are doing, but social media drives me nuts. It makes me want kinds of validation that hold no actual value to me. I do want to leave my day job- but most of all I hope that people see what I make and gain something constructive, worthwhile or meaningful from it.*
